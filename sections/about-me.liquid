            <p>Hey! I'm Jeremy, a Shopify Developer and E-commerce Expert.</p>
            <p>I created this website for a client in <b style="color: #acdeff">less than 10 hours!</b><br>
            Everything has been coded from scratch using the theme Dawn as a base. I also did the photo editing myself.<br>
            Some photos are coming from the HiSmile website.
            </p>
            <p>If you are interested in working with me, you can contact me through my <a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0164fbb033c81211db">Upwork Profile</a>.</p>
            <p>Looking forward to speak with you about your project. Cheers! :)</p>
